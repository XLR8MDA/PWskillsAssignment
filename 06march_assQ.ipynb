    "Q5. Explain the concept of levels of \n",
    "Levels of measurement, also known as scales of measurement, are a way to classify data based on the nature and properties of the data. There are four main levels of measurement: nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio.\n",
    "Nominal: This is the lowest level of measurement and refers to data that can be categorized but not ranked or ordered. Examples of nominal variables include gender (male/female), eye color (blue/brown/green), and race (Caucasian/Asian/African American).\n",
    "Ordinal: This level of measurement refers to data that can be ranked or ordered, but the differences between values are not necessarily equal. Examples of ordinal variables include educational level (high school diploma, bachelor's degree, master's degree), socioeconomic status (low, middle, high), and survey responses (strongly agree, agree, disagree, strongly disagree).\n",
    "Interval: This level of measurement refers to data where the differences between values are equal, but there is no true zero point. Examples of interval variables include temperature measured in degrees Celsius or Fahrenheit, and time measured in hours, minutes, and seconds.\n",
    "Ratio: This is the highest level of measurement and refers to data that have a true zero point, meaning that the value of zero represents the absence of the variable. Examples of ratio variables include weight, height, income, and number of children."

    "example to illustrate your answer.\n",
    "It is important to understand the level of measurement of data when analyzing it because it affects the type of statistical analysis that can be performed. For example, nominal and ordinal data can only be analyzed using non-parametric statistical tests, while interval and ratio data can be analyzed using both parametric and non-parametric statistical tests. Understanding the level of measurement also helps in choosing the appropriate statistical measures and visualizations to use when summarizing and presenting the data.\n",
    "For instance, if we were analyzing the effectiveness of a new medication, understanding the level of measurement of the data would be important in determining the appropriate statistical test to use. If the data was nominal (e.g., cured/not cured), we might use a chi-square test to compare the proportion of cured patients in the treatment and control groups. If the data was interval (e.g., levels of pain on a scale from 1-10), we might use a t-test or ANOVA to compare the mean pain scores in the treatment and control groups."

    "Q7. How nominal data type is different from ordinal data type.\n",
    "Nominal data refers to data that can be categorized but not ranked or ordered, while ordinal data can be ranked or ordered, but the differences between values are not necessarily equal. Nominal data are categorical in nature and do not imply any kind of numerical relationship between categories, while ordinal data imply a natural order or hierarchy between categories.\n",
    "For example, eye color is a nominal variable because there is no inherent order or hierarchy between the categories of blue, brown, and green. On the other hand, educational level is an ordinal variable because there is a natural order or hierarchy between the categories of high school diploma, bachelor's degree, and master's degree. However, the differences between these categories are not necessarily equal, as the difference between a high school diploma and a bachelor's degree may not be the same as the difference between a bachelor's degree and a master's degree.\n"

    "Q8. Which type of plot can be used to display data in terms of range?\n",
    "A box plot, also known as a box and whisker plot, can be used to display data in terms of range. A box plot summarizes the distribution of a dataset by showing the median, quartiles, and outliers. The box represents the middle 50% of the data (between the first and third quartiles), while the whiskers extend to the highest and lowest values that are not considered outliers. Box plots are particularly useful for comparing the range and spread of data between different groups or categories.\n"

    "Q9. Describe the difference between descriptive and inferential statistics. Give an example of each type of statistics and explain how they are used.\n",
    "Descriptive statistics is a branch of statistics that involves summarizing and describing the characteristics of a dataset, such as measures of central tendency, variability, and distribution. Descriptive statistics are used to gain an understanding of the data, to identify patterns and trends, and to communicate the results to others. Examples of descriptive statistics include calculating the mean, median, and standard deviation of a dataset, and creating histograms or box plots to visualize the data.\n",

    "Inferential statistics, on the other hand, is a branch of statistics that involves making inferences or predictions about a population based on a sample of data. Inferential statistics are used to test hypotheses, to estimate parameters, and to make predictions about future data. Examples of inferential statistics include hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and regression analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we were interested in studying the effect of a new exercise program on weight loss, we might collect weight data from a sample of participants before and after the program. Descriptive statistics would be used to summarize and describe the characteristics of the weight data, such as the mean, median, and standard deviation. Inferential statistics would be used to test whether there was a significant difference in weight loss between the pre- and post-program measurements, and to estimate the size of the effect."

    "Measures of central tendency and variability are used to describe the characteristics of a dataset. Some common measures of central tendency include the mean, median, and mode, while some common measures of variability include the range, standard deviation, and variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean: The mean is the arithmetic average of a dataset and is calculated by adding up all the values and dividing by the number of values. The mean is often used as a measure of central tendency when the data is normally distributed and there are no outliers.\n",

    "Median: The median is the middle value of a dataset when the values are arranged in order. The median is often used as a measure of central tendency when the data is skewed or has outliers.\n",

    "Standard deviation: The standard deviation measures the spread of the data around the mean and is calculated by taking the square root of the variance. The standard deviation is often used as a measure of variability to describe how much the values deviate from the mean.\n",

    "Variance: The variance measures the average squared deviation of the values from the mean. The variance is often used as a measure of variability to describe the spread of the data around the mean.\n",
