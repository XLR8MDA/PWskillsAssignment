    "Q2: How can we reduce overfitting? Explain in brief.\n",
    "There are several techniques to reduce overfitting in machine learning, including:\n",
    "Cross-validation: This technique involves splitting the data into training and validation sets and training the model on the training set. The model is then evaluated on the validation set to determine if it is overfitting the training data.\n",
    "Regularization: Regularization is a technique that adds a penalty term to the loss function of the model. This penalty term helps to reduce the complexity of the model and prevent overfitting.\n",
    "Early stopping: Early stopping involves stopping the training process when the model starts to overfit the training data. This is done by monitoring the performance of the model on a validation set and stopping the training process when the performance starts to deteriorate.\n",
    "Dropout: Dropout is a technique that randomly drops out some of the neurons in the model during training. This helps to prevent overfitting by reducing the capacity of the model.\n"

    "\n",
    "The bias-variance tradeoff is a fundamental concept in machine learning that refers to the relationship between the complexity of a model and its ability to generalize to new data. Bias refers to the degree to which a model consistently misrepresents the underlying patterns in the data, while variance refers to the degree to which a model varies when trained on different datasets. In general, more complex models have lower bias but higher variance, while simpler models have higher bias but lower variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The bias and variance of a model can affect its performance in different ways. Models with high bias tend to underfit the data, while models with high variance tend to overfit the data. Overfitting occurs when a model captures the noise in the data rather than the underlying patterns, while underfitting occurs when a model is not able to capture the complexity of the data.\n"
