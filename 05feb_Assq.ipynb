    "In object-oriented programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint or template for creating objects, while an object is an instance of a class.\n",
    "A class defines the common attributes (data) and behaviors (methods) that objects of that class will have. It provides a blueprint for creating multiple objects with similar characteristics.\n",
    "An object, on the other hand, is a specific instance of a class. It represents a unique entity that has its own set of attribute values and can perform actions defined by the class."

    "Q2. Name the four pillars of OOPs.\n",
    "Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the practice of bundling data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit (class). It hides the internal details of an object and provides public interfaces to interact with it. Encapsulation helps in achieving data abstraction and information hiding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance: Inheritance allows the creation of new classes (derived classes) based on existing classes (base or parent classes). It enables the derived classes to inherit the attributes and behaviors of the base class. Inheritance promotes code reuse and supports the concept of the \"is-a\" relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class. It enables the same method to be used with objects of different classes, providing flexibility and extensibility. Polymorphism is achieved through method overriding and method overloading.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction: Abstraction involves representing complex real-world entities as simplified models within a program. It focuses on the essential characteristics of an object, ignoring the irrelevant details. Abstraction helps in managing complexity, enhances code readability, and allows for easier maintenance and modification."

    "In object-oriented programming (OOP), the self parameter is used to refer to the instance of a class. It is a convention in Python to use self as the first parameter of instance methods.\n",
    "The self parameter allows instance methods to access and modify the attributes and methods of the object to which they belong. It acts as a reference to the instance itself.\n",
    "When you call an instance method on an object, you don't need to explicitly pass the self argument. Python automatically binds the method call to the instance."
