    "Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that involves training a computer system to learn from data, without being explicitly programmed. This allows the system to improve its performance over time and make predictions or decisions based on the patterns it has learned. Example- Investment Predictor\n",

The goal of supervised learning is to learn a function that can accurately map input variables to their corresponding output variables."

It is important to have a validation set to prevent overfitting, where the model becomes too complex and performs well on the training set but poorly on unseen data.\n",

    "\n",
    "Unsupervised learning can be used for anomaly detection by identifying patterns or clusters within the data and detecting any data points that fall outside of those patterns or clusters. One common approach is to use clustering algorithms, such as k-means or DBSCAN, to group similar data points together. Any data point that does not fit into any cluster or belongs to a small or sparse cluster can be flagged as an anomaly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another approach is to use dimensionality reduction techniques, such as principal component analysis (PCA) or t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE), to reduce the dimensionality of the data while preserving its structure. Any data point that has a large distance from the rest of the data points in the reduced space can be considered an anomaly.\n"
