    "\n",
    "'r': Read mode (default). Opens a file for reading. Raises an error if the file does not exist.\n",
    "'w': Write mode. Opens a file for writing. Creates a new file if it doesn't exist or truncates the file if it exists.\n",
    "'a': Append mode. Opens a file for appending. The file pointer is at the end of the file, and new data is written to the end.\n",
    "'x': Exclusive creation mode. Opens a file for exclusive creation. Raises an error if the file already exists.\n",
    "'b': Binary mode. Opens a file in binary mode.\n",
    "'t': Text mode (default). Opens a file in text mode.\n",
